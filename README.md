"Angular generator also supports creating new views, directives and controllers for you. A new controller can be scaffolded by running `yo angular:route routeName`, which will create your controller files but also update the route in app.js for you. We also try scaffolding out unit tests where possible.

To find out all the Yeoman commands for the Angular generator take a look at the [generator readme](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular#readme)."
